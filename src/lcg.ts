/**
 * A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) is a simple pseudo-random number
 * generator that uses a linear recurrence equation to generate a sequence of
 * numbers. The recurrence equation is:
 *
 *  Xn+1 = (a * Xn + c) mod m
 *  where:
 *  Xn is the current state
 *  a is the multiplier
 *  c is the increment
 *  m is the modulus
 *  and the initial state X0 is called the seed.
 *
 *  The modulus m must be greater than 0
 *  The multiplier a must be greater than 0 and less than m
 *  The increment c must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than m
 *  The seed X0 must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than m
 *
 *  The generator has a full cycle when the following conditions are met:
 *  c and m are relatively prime
 *  a - 1 is divisible by all prime factors of m
 *  a - 1 is a multiple of 4 if m is a multiple of 4
 *
